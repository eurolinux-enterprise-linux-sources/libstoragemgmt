.SH NAME
targetd_lsmplugin -- libStorageMgmt targetd plugin

.SH DESCRIPTION
LibStorageMgmt targetd plugin allows user to manage storage using
the targetd storage API [1]. The 'targetd_lsmplugin' executable file is for
libStorageMgmt daemon to execute when client user specifies targetd plugin in
the URI.

.SH URI
To use this plugin, users should set their URI to this format:
.nf

    # HTTP connection
    \fBtargetd://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>\fR

    # HTTPS connection
    \fBtargetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>\fR

    # HTTPS connection with certificate file
    \fBtargetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>?ca_cert_file=<full path and filename>\fR

    # HTTPS connection disabling all certificate checks (not recommended for production)
    \fBtargetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>?no_ssl_verify=yes\fR

.fi

.TP
\fBusername\fR

The \fBusername\fR is the user account configured in targetd configuration
file.

.TP
\fBtargetd_server\fR

The \fBtargetd_server\fR is the IP address or DNS name of server running
targetd daemon.

.TP
\fBport number\fR

The \fBport number\fR is the listening port of the targetd daemon.  The default
port of 18700 is used if none is supplied on the URI.

.TP
\fBURI parameters\fR
These URI parameters are supported by this plugin:

.RS 7

.TP
\fBca_cert_file=<certificate file>\fR
This URI parameter is for SSL connections only.  For those users that
utilize a self signed certificate you can pass the path and file to the
certificate that should be used to verify the server certificate.

.TP
\fBno_ssl_verify=yes\fR
This URI parameter is for SSL connections only. With this URI parameter,
the targetd plugin will not validate servers SSL certificate.
It's often used for self-signed CA environment, but it's strongly suggested to
remove this URI parameter and install self-signed CA properly, or use cert_file
parameter instead.

.SH SUPPORTED SOFTWARE
Linux targetd 0.7.1 or later version.
Detailed support status can be queried via:

 * \fBlsm.Client.capabilities()\fR  (Python API)
 * \fBlsm_capabilities()\fR         (C API)
 * \fBlsmcli capabilities\fR        (lsmcli command line).

.SH FIREWALL RULES
By default, this plugin requires access to the targetd server's TCP 18700
port.
